# Darray
Dynamic array for Arduino

I introduced this library so that we'b be able to use Dynamic arrays, so that we'd save ourselves some space in our microcontrollers, which is already a scare comodity in those tiny systems.
I am doing this simply using linked lists and am a bit scared to use malloc(), for am not sure how'd it go with microcontrollers, as functions like those happen to be very rare in the arduino world, I am guessing there has to be a reason to it.
However, I'd definitly give it a try and any help is welcomed.

Tasks to do:

  1.write 2 Get() functions
  2.write 2 Put() functions
  3.write size() function
  4.write 2 Del() functions
  5.Write the same functions for other data types
